## Running flocking example
1. Go to vi/simulation.py and change line 433 with:  
2. self._background.fill((255, 255, 255))  
3. Open your favorite Python editor and run simple_flocking.py

## Running source localization
1. Simply run source_loc.py.
2. If you want to run it from terminal, you might need to change the paths in:
   3. source_lock.py lines 5 and 11
